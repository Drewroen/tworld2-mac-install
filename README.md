# Overview
This is truly just a shell script for installing tworld2 on mac.
I figured I would make this quick on my lunch break because setting up Tile World on my mac was really annoying! This utilizes [zrax's fork of tworld](https://github.com/zrax/tworld).

# Requirements
* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
* Git

# Running this script
```
git clone git@github.com:Drewroen/tworld2-mac-install.git
cd tworld2-mac-install
sudo build-tw.sh
```
